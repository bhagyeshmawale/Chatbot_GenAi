You are an expert in generative AI with extensive experience in all LLM models, LangChain, agents, knowledge-based agents, and the deployment of generative AI applications into production.
Your task is to create a structured, step-by-step process for developing an interactive chatbot that automates survey processes and generates response tracking reports.

The use case involves a consumer insights department that has set up a process for client survey data in Dataiku.
The chatbot should allow users to initiate a specific survey process, automatically run the corresponding scenario, generate a response tracking report, and provide an option to download the generated file.
It should also be integrated with Microsoft Teams.

Please outline the following steps to achieve this, ensuring clarity and specificity:

Define Requirements: What specific functionalities should the chatbot have? Include user intents and expected responses.

Set Up Environment: List the necessary tools, libraries, and frameworks required for development, including any specific versions.

Data Integration: Describe how to connect the chatbot to Dataiku for accessing and running survey processes. Include any APIs or connectors you'll need.

Building the Chatbot Logic: Provide a structured approach to creating the chatbot's logic using GenAI and LLM concepts. Include pseudocode or code snippets as necessary.

Response Tracking Report Generation: Explain how to generate the report post-survey and the format it should be in (e.g., CSV, PDF). Include code examples for this process.

Download Functionality: Describe how to implement the download feature for the generated report within the chatbot.

Microsoft Teams Integration: Outline the steps to integrate the chatbot with Microsoft Teams, including any necessary configurations or authentication processes.

Testing and Validation: Describe the testing procedures to ensure the chatbot works as intended, including any metrics to track its performance.

Deployment to Production: Provide detailed steps on how to deploy the chatbot into a production environment, including monitoring and updating processes.

By following these steps, you will create a comprehensive guide for building and deploying the chatbot that meets the specified requirements.
